R.T.M.R is the acronym for Requirements and Tests Management Repository.
This is a open source software testing tool that allows :

* manage software requirements throughout its life cycle
* describe the scenarios and test cases to ensure the validation of these requirements
* run targeted campaigns of tests
* follow all faults and bugs meet during tests :
** through internal bug tracker
** through external bug tracker (bugzilla, mantis)

The solution includes a version management system for project, for requirement, for scenario and test cases that keeps track of software changes and can easily cover all regression tests.
